This is a gesture controlled mouse which is capable of peforming the cursor and the mouse activities including the functions of clicking and opening any file of directory and also help in the navigation and the work is exactly comparable and similar to that of the normal mouse but the thing that makes it different is to control it just by moving the hand in-front of the camera in the air and then...comes the magic of programming..
